# Instructions for AI

When working on this project:

1. **Read CONTEXT.md first** — it has deployment info, services, and paths.

2. **If blocked** — ask a single, specific question. Example: "Is your Cloudflare Pages project connected to GitHub, and which repo?"

3. **Edits** — make changes when asked. Don't hesitate to edit multiple files for one task.

4. **Deploy** — after code changes, remind the user to deploy (or run the deploy command) so launchpadai.click gets the update.

5. **Update context yourself** — when you add configs, change deployment, add services, or alter paths, update CONTEXT.md (and any other relevant files) yourself. Do not ask the user to manually update these files.
