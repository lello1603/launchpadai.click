# LaunchPad App — Cursor Rules

## Project
- React + Vite + TypeScript app. Uses Tailwind and Framer Motion.
- Domain: launchpadai.click. Hosted on Cloudflare.

## Conventions
- Components in `components/`, services in `services/`.
- Use existing patterns (e.g. `motion as any` for framer-motion).
- API keys live in Supabase Edge Function secrets, not in frontend code.

## When you need user input
- Ask one clear, specific question.
- Avoid open-ended or multi-part questions when possible.
- Example: "Which Git branch is connected to Cloudflare deploys?" instead of "How do you deploy?"

## Reference
- Read `CONTEXT.md` for deployment, services, and paths before making changes.

## Maintenance
- When you add configs, change deployment, add services, or alter paths, update `CONTEXT.md` yourself. Do not rely on the user to manually maintain it.
